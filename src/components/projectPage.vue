  <br>Currently,  the  company  uses  an  external Business Management service to store and retrieve data for all transactions,
  called MYOB (Mind Your Own Business). Transactions include:</p>

  <ul style="color: blue; text-align: left">
  <li>Placing orders</li>
    <li>Restocking inventory</li>
    <li>Producing invoices</li>
    <li>Tracking client activity.</li>
  </ul>

    <p style="color: blue; text-align: left">They wish to have their own service to store their data and carry out these transactions. <br> This project was built
    using Java and Sprint Boot as well as Vue.js.</p>
